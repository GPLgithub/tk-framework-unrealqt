This script helps building and shipping Python packages
with this framework.

It uses virtual env and pip to do so, so you will need them
on your machine to use this script. On Windows, git-bash is
needed.

== Typical workflow ================================================

* Run this script once with no option to get a virtual env and a
 requirements.txt file
* Use the virtual env to install packages with standard pip install
 or update commands
* Update the requirements.txt file with pip freeze -r requirements.txt > requirements.txt
* Build and copy the packages into their shipping destination with the
 -b option
* Run some tests
* Update git with the copied packages and push


== Structure =======================================================

* This script use a "packagevenv_$platform_name_$python_major_version" virtual env to
 do packages downloads and buildings, where platform_name can either
 be "linux", "osx" or "windows".
* Packages are shipped in "../python/vendors/py${python_major_version}/${platform_name}".
 They are full copy of the virtual env for the current platform,
 with .pyc and .egg-info files deleted.
* They need to be added in git to ship with the framework
* Packages dependencies are stored in a standard requirements.txt
 pip file, build with regular pip commands

== Starting from scratch ===========================================

* A virtual env for the current platform will be created if needed
 by running the script without any option.
* An empty requirements.txt will be created if needed

== Building packages for a platform ================================

* If you are on Windows, you will have to run the script from
 a git-bash, NOT a cygwin shell, as cygmin will not use the right
 compiler and libraries
* On Windows, A Microsoft Visual C++ for Python 2.7 can be downloaded from :
 http://aka.ms/vcpython27
* Just run the script with the -b option, and all needed packages
 should be downloaded, build and copied into the shipping folder

== Adding packages =================================================

* Activate the virtual env for your platform, e.g. :
  source packagevenv_linux/bin/activate
* Install / update packages using pip, e.g. :
     pip install pycrypto
* Update the requirements.txt file :
     pip freeze -r requirements.txt > requirements.txt
* It is possible to edit the requirements.txt manually, although this
 is not recommended
* Copy the packages into their shipping location with the -b option

== Commiting packages in git ========================================

* Go into ../python/vendors shipping directory, and do:
    git add -f -A ./$platform
 where $platform is the platform name you want to update.
* The -f option is used to bypass .gitignore and add .so or .dll files.
