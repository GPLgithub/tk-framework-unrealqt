    Plugin for publishing an open maya session as an exported FBX.

    the publish2 app and should inherit from it in the configuration. The hook

        hook: "{self}/publish_file.py:{config}/tk-multi-publish2/tk-maya/basic/publish_fbx.py"

               since it is not possible to derive from it to publish something
               else than a Maya scene, and since it populates properties on the
               publish item rather than using local properties, so it conflicts
               with other plugins acting on the same item.
